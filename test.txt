// Parking Ramp simulator

/*
    we have a problem with employees not knowing where to park, and having to go all around all of the parking ramps to find a spot
    we also collect all of the parking ramp data of what cars are parked where currently and what spots are open
    we'd like you to create a function that will give back what spot the employee should park at, and update the parking data
    here is the structure of parking.json, which is the data of what parking ramp data we have currently:

    {
        ramps: [
            {
                number: '1'
                location: '711 High Street'
                floors: [
                    [
                        { spot: 1, handicap: false, small_spot: true, under_construction: false, is_occupied: false },
                        { spot: 2, handicap: true, small_spot: false, under_construction: false, is_occupied: true },
                        { spot: 3, handicap: false, small_spot: false, under_construction: false, is_occupied: true },
                        { spot: 4, handicap: true, small_spot: false, under_construction: true, is_occupied: false },
                        ...
                    ],
                    ...
                ]
            },
            ...
        ]
    }
*/
